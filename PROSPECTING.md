# Municipal Prospecting Global Rules & Guidelines

### üîÑ Workflow Orchestration & Context
- **Always read the specific workflow file** before executing each phase (discovery.md, research.md, verification.md, targeting.md, output.md)
- **Follow the phase sequence strictly** - each phase depends on successful completion of the previous phase
- **Validate data integrity** between phases using JSON validation and checkpoint commands
- **Use consistent naming conventions** for files, variables, and data structures across all workflows

### üéØ Target Entity Guidelines
- **INCLUDE ONLY**: Municipal governments, county offices, municipal police/fire departments, municipal utilities, parks & recreation departments, public works departments
- **EXCLUDE ALWAYS**: Federal agencies, state agencies, school districts, universities, private companies, contractors, regional authorities spanning multiple counties
- **VERIFY JURISDICTION**: Ensure all entities are truly municipal/local government before inclusion
- **FOCUS ON DECISION MAKERS**: Prioritize contacts with technology budget authority and influence

### üìû Contact Quality Standards
- **Multi-source verification required**: 80% minimum verification rate through official websites + LinkedIn + professional networks
- **Currency validation mandatory**: All contact information must be verified within 6 months of generation
- **Format validation**: Email addresses and phone numbers must conform to standard formats
- **Employment verification**: Confirm current employment status through multiple sources
- **NO HALLUCINATION**: Never fabricate contact information - mark as unavailable if not found

### üîç Research Methodology Rules
- **Primary sources first**: Always start with official municipal websites for contact discovery
- **County government priority**: Spend 8-10 minutes on county government (should yield 15-25% of total contacts)
- **Department-specific research**: Hit individual county department pages, not just main staff directory
- **Secondary verification**: Use LinkedIn professional profiles for employment confirmation
- **Tertiary validation**: Cross-reference with professional associations (ICMA, IACP, APWA, NRPA)
- **Document all sources**: Track verification sources for each piece of contact information
- **Handle access restrictions**: Use alternative search strategies when websites are limited

### üì± T-Mobile Product Targeting Guidelines
- **IT/Technology contacts**: 5G infrastructure, enterprise plans, IoT solutions, smart city technologies
- **Executive/Administrative**: Enterprise communications, cost optimization, strategic municipal solutions
- **Public Safety contacts**: Emergency communications, FirstNet, mobile data plans, vehicle connectivity  
- **Public Works contacts**: IoT sensors, asset monitoring, field team communications, infrastructure solutions
- **Parks/Recreation contacts**: Public WiFi, event connectivity, digital community services
- **Match authority to products**: Align product complexity and cost with contact's decision-making level

### ‚úÖ Data Integrity & Validation
- **JSON structure validation**: All intermediate data files must validate against expected schemas
- **Checkpoint validation**: Each workflow phase must pass validation gates before proceeding
- **Error handling**: Gracefully handle missing data, access restrictions, and verification failures
- **Quality scoring**: Apply consistent quality metrics and confidence scoring across all contacts
- **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate contacts and consolidate information from multiple sources

### üìä Output Standards & Formatting
- **Standardized structure**: Follow consistent formatting for prospect lists across all counties
- **Complete information**: Include all available contact details, targeting, and verification status
- **Quality metrics**: Document verification rates, confidence levels, and data currency
- **Usage instructions**: Provide clear guidance on contact currency and recommended usage
- **File naming**: Use consistent naming convention: [County]_[State]_Prospects_[YYYY-MM-DD].txt

### üèõÔ∏è Municipal Research Best Practices
- **Understand local government structures**: Adapt research approach for different municipal organizations
- **Account for size differences**: Tailor product targeting for large vs. small municipalities
- **Respect budget cycles**: Note municipal fiscal year patterns where discoverable
- **Consider technology readiness**: Assess municipal technology sophistication for appropriate targeting
- **Geographic awareness**: Understand regional municipal patterns and conventions

### üö´ Prohibited Practices
- **Never include federal or state employees** regardless of local presence or cooperation
- **Never add private sector contacts** even if they work closely with municipal entities
- **Never fabricate contact information** when not discoverable through research
- **Never skip verification steps** for speed or convenience
- **Never include outdated information** without attempting current verification
- **Never bypass exclusion criteria** for higher contact volumes

### üîÑ Workflow Error Handling
- **Checkpoint failures**: If validation gates fail, retry with extended methodology before proceeding
- **Low verification rates**: Expand verification sources and extend research timeframe
- **Access restrictions**: Use cached content, alternative sources, and backup research strategies
- **Missing critical contacts**: Flag gaps and suggest manual research for high-priority positions
- **Data quality issues**: Apply quality flags and confidence scoring rather than excluding contacts

### üìà Success Metrics & Quality Assurance
- **80% minimum verification rate**: Across all contacts in final prospect list
- **90% municipality coverage**: Extract contacts from 90%+ of discovered municipal entities
- **Complete targeting**: 100% of verified contacts must have T-Mobile product assignments
- **Format compliance**: Zero format errors in email addresses, phone numbers, and data structure
- **Currency compliance**: All information verified within acceptable timeframe limits

### üéØ Sales Focus & Prioritization
- **Tier 1 priority**: Executive decision makers, IT directors, large municipality contacts
- **Tier 2 priority**: Department heads, medium municipality contacts, strong influence
- **Tier 3 priority**: Technical influencers, small municipality contacts, relationship building
- **Product alignment**: Ensure T-Mobile product recommendations match contact authority and needs
- **Sales approach customization**: Tailor messaging and approach strategy by contact type and municipality

### üß† AI Behavior Rules for Prospecting
- **Research comprehensively**: Use multiple search strategies and sources for each municipality
- **Verify independently**: Don't rely on single sources for contact information
- **Think systematically**: Approach each workflow phase methodically and completely
- **Handle uncertainty**: When information is unclear, mark appropriately rather than guess
- **Maintain context**: Remember the T-Mobile sales focus throughout all research activities
- **Document decisions**: Explain reasoning for inclusion/exclusion and verification choices
